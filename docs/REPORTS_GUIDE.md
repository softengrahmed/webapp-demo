- Resource utilization

### 5. Cost Analysis Report
**Location:** `deployment-reports/run-{number}-{timestamp}/cost-analysis.md`

**Contents:**
- Monthly cost breakdown

### 6. Deployment Checklist
**Location:** `deployment-reports/run-{number}-{timestamp}/deployment-checklist.md`

**Contents:**
- Pre-deployment verification
- Step-by-step deployment tasks
- Post-deployment validation
- Rollback procedures
- Emergency contacts

## Accessing Reports

### From GitHub Actions

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on the specific workflow run
3. Scroll to **Artifacts** section
4. Download `deployment-reports-{run-number}`
5. Extract and open reports

### From AWS S3 (if configured)

```bash
# List available reports
aws s3 ls s3://webapp-demo-reports/

# Download specific report
aws s3 sync s3://webapp-demo-reports/run-123-20250814-120000/ ./reports/
```

## Report Retention

| Report Type | Retention Period | Storage Location |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| HTML Reports | 30 days | GitHub Artifacts |
| Build Logs | 30 days | GitHub Artifacts |
| Deployment Logs | 30 days | GitHub Artifacts |
| AWS Metrics | 7 days | CloudWatch |
| Cost Reports | 90 days | AWS Cost Explorer |

## Automated Report Generation

### During Build Stage
- Package manager setup logs
- Dependency installation logs
- Test results
- Coverage reports
- Build artifacts list

### During Deployment Stage
- AWS service interactions
- Resource creation logs
- Configuration changes
- Error messages
- Success confirmations

### Post-Deployment
- Performance metrics
- Cost analysis
- Resource utilization
- Cleanup recommendations

## Understanding Cost Reports

### Free Tier Tracking

The pipeline tracks AWS Free Tier usage:

```markdown
| Service | Free Tier Limit | Current Usage | Remaining |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Lambda | 1M requests | 50K | 950K |
| S3 | 5GB storage | 0.5GB | 4.5GB |
```

### Cost Projections

Monthly cost estimates based on current usage:

```markdown
Current Daily Rate: $0.02
Projected Monthly: $0.60
Budget Remaining: $4.40
```

## Manual Cleanup Procedures

### Immediate Cleanup (Staging)

```bash
# Remove all staging resources
./scripts/cleanup-staging.sh
```

### Weekly Cleanup (Automated)

Runs every Monday at 2 AM UTC:
- Removes S3 buckets older than 7 days
- Deletes old Lambda versions
- Cleans CloudWatch logs

### Manual Emergency Cleanup

```bash
# List all resources
aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources \
  --tag-filters Key=Project,Values=webapp-demo

# Delete specific resources
aws s3 rb s3://webapp-demo-staging-XXX --force
aws lambda delete-function --function-name webapp-demo-api-staging
```

## Monitoring Dashboard URLs

### CloudWatch Dashboard
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards:name=webapp-demo-dashboard
```

### Cost Explorer
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home#/cost-explorer
```

### Lambda Console
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions
```

## Troubleshooting Reports

### Missing Reports

1. Check GitHub Actions artifacts
2. Verify pipeline completed successfully
3. Check artifact retention settings

### Incomplete AWS Metrics

1. Verify AWS credentials are configured
2. Check IAM permissions for CloudWatch
3. Ensure resources exist in the correct region

### Cost Data Not Available

1. Cost Explorer requires 24 hours for initial data
2. Ensure Cost Explorer is enabled in AWS account
3. Check IAM permissions for Cost Explorer API

## Report Customization

To customize reports, edit:

1. **HTML Template:** `.github/workflows/main-pipeline.yml` (Generate Pipeline Report step)
2. **Report Scripts:** `scripts/generate-report.sh`
3. **Markdown Templates:** Individual report generation functions

## Best Practices

1. **Review reports after each deployment**
2. **Monitor cost trends weekly**
3. **Archive important reports locally**
4. **Set up email alerts for budget thresholds**
5. **Perform monthly cleanup of old resources**
