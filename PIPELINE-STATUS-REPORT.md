## 🏗️ Architecture Deployed

### Frontend (React App)
```
Source Code (Nx) → Build (React) → Deploy (S3) → Serve (Static Website)
```

### Backend (Express API)
```
Source Code (Nx) → Build (Express) → Package (Lambda) → Deploy (API Gateway)
```

### Database (DynamoDB)
```
Schema → Create Table → Configure Access → API Integration
```

### CI/CD Flow
```
Push → Build → Test → Deploy AWS → Verify → Log → Cleanup
```
