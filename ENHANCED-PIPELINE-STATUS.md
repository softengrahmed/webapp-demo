## 📈 Expected Outcomes

- **Website URL**: `http://react-webapp-demo-[run-id].s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- **Total Cost**: $0.00 (100% Free Tier)
- **Execution Time**: ~15 minutes
- **Quality Gates**: 7 comprehensive phases

## 🔄 **CURRENT STATUS: PIPELINE TRIGGERED**

The fixed pipeline (v2.1) has been triggered. Monitoring execution:

### 🏃‍♂️ **EXECUTION MONITORING**
- Pipeline should start within 1-2 minutes
- Pre-validation phase: Expected ~2 minutes
- Main pipeline execution: Expected ~12 minutes
- Post-deployment validation: Expected ~3 minutes

### 📊 **KEY FIXES MONITORING**
1. **Yarn 3.x Audit**: Should pass without "script not found" error
2. **Build Process**: Should detect and build Nx project successfully
3. **Security Scanning**: Should complete without command errors
4. **Deployment**: Should deploy to S3 and provide live URL
